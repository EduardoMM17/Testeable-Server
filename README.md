# Testeable-Server
This is a repo where I try to create a Testeable Server in Node JS

## Description
This is a repo that mocks a bigger project. What I am trying to accomplish here is to be able to spy on middlewares that are used when calling an API.

## Start the server
npm start

## Run tests
npm test
